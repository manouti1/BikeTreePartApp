# BikeTreeDemo App


This program calculates the maximum number of bike bundles that can be built by considering the inventory of seats, pedals, and wheels. It assumes that the number of wheels is unlimited for simplicity. The CalculateMaxBundles function calculates the maximum number of bundles based on each part, and the overall result is the minimum of the three, as you can only build as many bundles as the scarcest part allows.
